# LeetCode Speedrun

## Introduction

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a software developer at TIAA, and I've recently embarked on a journey to tackle LeetCode problems to enhance my programming skills.

## About Me

The solutions and code you'll find here are a reflection of my hobby, and they may not necessarily represent the quality of code I produce in my professional life. LeetCode has been recommended by many as a great way to improve programming skills, so I decided to give it a try.

## Disclaimer

Please note that some of my solutions might appear a bit rushed or incomplete. I work on these problems during my free time, and the last thing I want is to encounter a bug in my hobby projects when I'm already dealing with bugs at work.

## Feedback and Contact

I'm always open to suggestions and feedback. Feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rashil-dudhara/) since I may not be as active on GitHub. Your insights and advice are highly appreciated.

## Acknowledgments

I'm following the [NeetCode.io](https://neetcode.io/roadmap) roadmap for my problem-solving journey. Special thanks to [NeetCode](https://www.youtube.com/@NeetCode) for providing the motivation and resources to get started.

Let's code and learn together! ðŸš€
